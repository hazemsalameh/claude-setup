A collection of slash commands for Claude Code CLI designed to streamline system administration, optimization, and configuration tasks on Linux desktop systems. 

Also provided: a script for setting up a repo-style workspace for Claude Code to focus on sysadmin tasks. The script populates a `CLAUDE.md` describing the purpose and creates (or on subsequent runs non-destructively syncs) the slash command library in this repo.

### Automated Workspace Setup

This repository includes a setup script that creates a dedicated Claude Code workspace for desktop system administration at `~/claude-spaces/desktop-sys-admin`.

**Run the setup script:**
```bash
bash ~/repos/github/Claude-Code-Linux-Desktop-Slash-Commands/setup-desktop-sysadmin-workspace.sh
```

**What the script does:**
1. Creates workspace directory structure at `~/claude-spaces/desktop-sys-admin`
2. Syncs all 93+ slash commands to `.claude/commands/` (organized by category)
3. Generates `CLAUDE.md` with workspace configuration and instructions
4. Gathers current system information (CPU, GPU, RAM, OS, network, dev tools) into `context/system-info.md`
5. Creates user-facing `README.md` documentation
6. Initializes a git repository for version control
7. Sets up `.gitignore` for temporary files

**Using the workspace:**
```bash
cd ~/claude-spaces/desktop-sys-admin
claude-code
```

Once in the workspace, Claude Code has full context about your system and access to all slash commands. Type `/` to see available commands organized by category.

**Updating the workspace:**

Re-run the setup script to sync the latest slash commands and refresh system information:
```bash
bash ~/repos/github/Claude-Code-Linux-Desktop-Slash-Commands/setup-desktop-sysadmin-workspace.sh
```

The script uses `rsync` to efficiently update only changed files while preserving the directory structure.

## Command Structure & Organization

### Two Directory Structures

This repository maintains slash commands in **two parallel structures**:

1. **`commands/`** - Organized by category in nested directories (primary source)
2. **`commands-flat/`** - Flattened structure with all commands in one directory

### Flattening Workflow

The `flatten-commands.sh` script converts the categorized structure into a flat structure for easy deployment to Claude Code workspaces.

**Run the flattening script:**
```bash
bash ~/repos/github/Claude-Code-Linux-Desktop-Slash-Commands/flatten-commands.sh
```

**What the script does:**
1. Clears the `commands-flat/` directory
2. Recursively finds all `.md` files in `commands/`
3. Flattens the directory structure by replacing `/` with `-` in filenames
4. Copies all commands to `commands-flat/`

**Example transformation:**
```
commands/system-health/system-upgrade.md → commands-flat/system-health-system-upgrade.md
commands/security/probe-vulnerabilities.md → commands-flat/security-probe-vulnerabilities.md
```

**When to use flattening:**
- Before copying commands to a Claude Code workspace
- When you need all commands in a single directory
- For easier deployment without preserving category structure

**Note:** The `setup-desktop-sysadmin-workspace.sh` script uses the categorized `commands/` structure (not the flattened version) to maintain organization in the workspace.
